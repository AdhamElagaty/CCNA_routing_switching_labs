# 🚀 CCNA 200-301 Lab Journey: From Basics to a Full Enterprise Network

Welcome to my comprehensive repository of Cisco Packet Tracer labs, documenting my hands-on journey through the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) curriculum. This collection starts with fundamental concepts and progressively builds upon them, culminating in a final capstone project that integrates all learned skills into a realistic, multi-site enterprise network.

This repository serves as both a personal learning journal and a practical resource for anyone studying for the CCNA certification. Each lab is self-contained, with detailed instructions, configuration files, and verification steps.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Skills Covered

This series of labs provides hands-on experience with a wide range of networking technologies, including:

*   **Routing:** Basic Router Configuration, Static Routing, and Dynamic Routing Protocols (RIP, EIGRP, OSPF).
*   **Switching:** VLANs, 802.1Q Trunking, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), PortFast, BPDU Guard, and EtherChannel (LACP).

## 🏆 The Capstone Project: Lab 13 - Final Enterprise Network

The final lab is a culmination of all the skills acquired. It involves building a complete enterprise network featuring a central headquarters, two remote branch offices, and a service provider backbone. This project integrates routing, switching, security, and management services into a single, cohesive, and functional network.

## 💻 Software Requirements

All labs were designed and tested using **Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x or later)**.

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

1.  **Navigate to a Lab Folder:** Each numbered folder represents a self-contained lab.
2.  **Read the Instructions:** The `README.md` file inside each folder provides a detailed objective, topology diagram, configuration steps, and verification commands.
3.  **Run the Lab:** Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer to interact with the pre-built topology.
4.  **Reference the Commands:** The `configs/commands.txt` file in each lab folder contains a complete, ready-to-use script of all the configurations applied to the devices.
